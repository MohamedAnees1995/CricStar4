# Machine Learning Project - **Mobile Price Range Prediction - Classification**

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting the price range of mobile phones. The mobile phone industry is highly competitive, and understanding the factors that influence the price range is crucial for market analysis and decision-making.

## **Project Summary**
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing various features of mobile phones and build a predictive model that can accurately classify the price range of a given phone as low, medium, high, or very high. The dataset consists of approximately 21 variables, including battery power, Bluetooth, camera quality, screen size, and more.

The project follows a structured workflow, encompassing data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, feature engineering, and machine learning model implementation. Here's a brief overview of each step:

**Data Wrangling**: Handle missing values and unique value checks. Replace erroneous 0 values for pixel resolution height and screen width with the mean values to ensure data consistency.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into the relationships between variables and the price range. Discover patterns, correlations, and distributions in the data. Identify significant factors affecting the price range, such as battery capacity, RAM, and pixel quality.

**Hypothesis Testing**: Perform statistical tests to validate hypotheses and identify significant factors. Handle outliers that may affect the model's performance.

**Feature Engineering**: Engineer new features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power. Select relevant features that contribute most to the price range prediction.

**Machine Learning Models**: Implement machine learning algorithms to build the predictive model. Evaluate various models, including logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, to determine the best-performing algorithm. Tune hyperparameters for improved model performance.

## **Conclusion**
This machine learning project provides insights into the factors influencing the price range of mobile phones. By leveraging the dataset's features, we successfully built a predictive model capable of accurately classifying mobile phone price ranges. The project highlights the significance of variables such as RAM, battery power, and pixel quality in determining the price range.
